            Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the CustomBeats Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.

The CustomBeats Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The CustomBeats Service is not directed to children whose age:

is under the age of 13 years
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.

If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, contact us.

If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.

When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old.


        </p>

        <h2>IX. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>The Company reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.
            We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.


        </p>
